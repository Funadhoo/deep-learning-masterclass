    "This notebook supports the 'Artificial Neural Network' chapter of the [1-day masterclass \"Deep Learning\"](https://aiblog.nl/masterclass-deep-learning). It is not ment as a full course on deep learning, but rather gives you a flavor of the topic. For an in-depth AI training or consultancy please contact [VBTI](https://vbti.nl). \n",
