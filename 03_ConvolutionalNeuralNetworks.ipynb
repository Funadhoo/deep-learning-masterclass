    "# Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "This notebook supports the 'Convolutional Neural Network' chapter of the [1-day masterclass \"Deep Learning\"](https://aiblog.nl/masterclass-deep-learning). It is not ment as a full course on deep learning, but rather gives you a flavor of the topic. For an in-depth AI training or consultancy please contact [VBTI](https://vbti.nl). \n",

    "Convolutional Neural Networks are a special type or Artificial Neural Networks. They are optimized to process image data. During the masterclass the details of convolution/maxpooling layers and CNN architectures are explained. In this notebook you will build and train an ANN to recognize objects in images.\n",
