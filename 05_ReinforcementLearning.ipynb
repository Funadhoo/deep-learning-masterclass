    "This notebook supports the 'Reinforcement Learning' chapter of the [1-day masterclass \"Deep Learning\"](https://aiblog.nl/masterclass-deep-learning). It is not ment as a full course on deep learning, but rather gives you a flavor of the topic. For an in-depth AI training or consultancy please contact [VBTI](https://vbti.nl). \n",

    "Reinforcement Learning is an AI technique to learn an optimal sequence of actions. During the masterclass details of the action-value method, Q-learning, exploration/exploitation, discount factor and Deep Reinforcement Learning are explained. In this notebook you will build and train a RL agent that needs to optimize planning taxi trips.\n",
