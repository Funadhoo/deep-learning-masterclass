    "Welcome to the 1-day masterclass \"Deep Learning\" provided by [VBTI](https://vbti.nl). During this masterclass you will get an overview of the latest developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence / Deep Learning. These notebooks let you explore some AI topics by yourself. They are not ment to be a full in-depth course, but rather should give you a flavor of different deep learning techniques. \n",
